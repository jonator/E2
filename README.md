# Group 8 Project

### Steps to use

- Clone the git repo
- `git clone https://github.com/jonator/cs560group8finalproject.git`
- if you don't have node.js installed, install it https://nodejs.org/en/
- run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies
- Get the .env file from a team member (or on the Trello) and place it in the root of the git repository (where the .gitignore is) to allow connection to the database
  - Also, you will need to make sure your IP Address is whitelisted on our server
  - Otherwise, you can use the database creation and seeding, and the procedure creation scripts to work on your own local database
- run `npm start` and a local server will start up
- go to http://localhost:3000 to view the app!
